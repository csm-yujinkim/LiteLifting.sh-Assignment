# Notes on the `wc` command

The `wc` command output is organized in this way:

1. The first field is the number of lines
2. The second field is the number of words
3. The third field is the number of bytes
4. The fifth field is the name of the file

Furthermore, `-l` option can be given for the number of lines, and `-w` and `-c` for the \# of words and \# of bytes, respectively.
